In this paper, authors modified Stollnerâ€™s Wave-U-Net ar- chitecture for vocal engineering. Vocal engineering is a step in the music production process where an engineer tunes and aligns all the vocal stems in a song such that they sound polished and precise. In this paper, 106 pairs of isolated vocal stems from eight all-vocal songs were used as training data, and 20 pairs of stems from two songs were used as validation. One stem in each pair was a raw vocal performance, and the second was hand tuned and aligned. The Wave-U-Net architecture has potential to work for this task, but so far it has not quite generalized to the validation set. Authors suggest future steps.
